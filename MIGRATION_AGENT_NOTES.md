# MIGRATION AGENT NOTES - IdeaHub Workspace Merge

**Last Updated**: Current Session
**Agent**: Migration Continuation Agent
**Repository**: CHRISILDAVID/ideahub_workspace_merge

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document tracks the migration progress from IDEA_HUB (Supabase) to ideahubORM (Prisma/PostgreSQL). The migration integrates the perfect navigation system from IDEA_HUB with the workspace functionality from ideahubORM.

### Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅ - Moving to Phase 2

---

## 🎯 MIGRATION OBJECTIVES

### Primary Goals
1. ✅ Migrate database from Supabase to Prisma/PostgreSQL
2. 🔄 Integrate IDEA_HUB navigation with ideahubORM workspace
3. 🔄 Preserve ALL frontend components, styles, and themes
4. 🔄 Implement complete user flow constraints
5. 🔄 Test and validate all functionality
6. ⏳ Document for future iterations

### User Flow Constraints (MUST FOLLOW)
- ✅ Every user can follow any other user
- ✅ An Idea consists of an only-view version of a workspace
- ✅ Idea creation prompts for title, description, and tags
- ✅ Workspace with idea name created and rendered simultaneously
- ✅ One workspace per idea (one-to-one relationship)
- ✅ Maximum 3 collaborators per idea (enforced at API level)
- ✅ Users can like ideas
- ✅ Users can comment on ideas
- ✅ Ideas can be PUBLIC or PRIVATE
- ✅ Public ideas: view-only for non-owner/collaborators, fork to edit
- ✅ Private ideas: only owner/collaborators can view/edit
- ✅ Route structure: `/user/idea/workspace/[id]`

- **Note**: DATABASE_URL in .env (gitignored)
- **Action Required**: None for agent (DB ready per user)

### Dependencies
- **Status**: ✅ Installed (npm install complete)
- **Location**: /home/runner/work/ideahub_workspace_merge/ideahub_workspace_merge/ideahubORM
- **Prisma Client**: Requires database connection to generate

### Build Status
- **Linter**: Some warnings (mostly unescaped apostrophes, missing deps in useEffect)
- **TypeScript**: Not yet checked
- **Build**: Not yet attempted (prisma client needs generation)

---

## 🎯 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

### Priority 1: Complete Phase 2 (Route Pages)
1. Update app/page.tsx to use HomePage component
2. Create all missing route pages with proper Next.js structure
3. Update app/layout.tsx with providers and proper imports
4. Test basic navigation

### Priority 2: Fix Import Paths (Phase 3)
1. Systematically update all import paths to Next.js format
2. Test each component as imports are fixed
3. Verify no broken imports remain

### Priority 3: API Integration (Phase 4)
1. Update service layer to use new API routes
2. Remove Supabase dependencies
3. Test API connections from frontend

---

## 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Constraints to Follow
1. **NO CHANGES** to component styles or themes
2. **NO CHANGES** to working workspace functionality
3. **PRESERVE** all user flow constraints
4. **ENFORCE** max 3 collaborators per idea
5. **MAINTAIN** one workspace per idea relationship

### Technical Decisions
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: To be decided (NextAuth.js recommended)
- **Styling**: Preserved from IDEA_HUB (idea-hub.css + globals.css)
- **State Management**: React Context (Auth, Theme)

### Known Issues
- Prisma client generation requires database connection (blocked by network)
- Some linter warnings need fixing (non-blocking)
- Import paths need updating throughout codebase
- Supabase API calls need replacing
