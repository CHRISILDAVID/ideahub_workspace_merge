# MIGRATION AGENT NOTES - IdeaHub Workspace Merge

**Last Updated**: Current Session
**Agent**: Migration Continuation Agent
**Repository**: CHRISILDAVID/ideahub_workspace_merge

---

## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document tracks the migration progress from IDEA_HUB (Supabase) to ideahubORM (Prisma/PostgreSQL). The migration integrates the perfect navigation system from IDEA_HUB with the workspace functionality from ideahubORM.

### Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ - Moving to Phase 2

---

## üéØ MIGRATION OBJECTIVES

### Primary Goals
1. ‚úÖ Migrate database from Supabase to Prisma/PostgreSQL
2. üîÑ Integrate IDEA_HUB navigation with ideahubORM workspace
3. üîÑ Preserve ALL frontend components, styles, and themes
4. üîÑ Implement complete user flow constraints
5. üîÑ Test and validate all functionality
6. ‚è≥ Document for future iterations

### User Flow Constraints (MUST FOLLOW)
- ‚úÖ Every user can follow any other user
- ‚úÖ An Idea consists of an only-view version of a workspace
- ‚úÖ Idea creation prompts for title, description, and tags
- ‚úÖ Workspace with idea name created and rendered simultaneously
- ‚úÖ One workspace per idea (one-to-one relationship)
- ‚úÖ Maximum 3 collaborators per idea (enforced at API level)
- ‚úÖ Users can like ideas
- ‚úÖ Users can comment on ideas
- ‚úÖ Ideas can be PUBLIC or PRIVATE
- ‚úÖ Public ideas: view-only for non-owner/collaborators, fork to edit
- ‚úÖ Private ideas: only owner/collaborators can view/edit
- ‚úÖ Route structure: `/user/idea/workspace/[id]`

## üîß CURRENT ENVIRONMENT STATUS

### Database
- **Status**: Schema defined, migrations ready
- **Note**: DATABASE_URL in .env (gitignored)
- **Action Required**: None for agent (DB ready per user)

### Dependencies
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Installed (npm install complete)
- **Location**: /home/runner/work/ideahub_workspace_merge/ideahub_workspace_merge/ideahubORM
- **Prisma Client**: Requires database connection to generate

### Build Status

- **TypeScript**: Not yet checked
- **Build**: Not yet attempted (prisma client needs generation)

---

## üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

### Priority 1: Authentication Implementation (Phase 5)
The current stub AuthContext needs to be replaced with a real authentication system:

**Option A: NextAuth.js (Recommended)**
1. Install: `npm install next-auth`
2. Create `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
3. Configure Credentials provider with Prisma
4. Update AuthContext to use NextAuth session
5. Add middleware for protected routes

**Option B: Custom Session-based Auth**
1. Implement `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` with bcrypt
2. Implement `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
3. Implement session cookie management
4. Add middleware.ts for route protection
5. Update AuthContext with real API calls

### Priority 2: Connect Services to API Routes (Phase 5)
1. Update app/services/api/auth.ts to call `/api/users` and auth endpoints
2. Update app/services/api/ideas.ts to call `/api/ideas/*` endpoints
3. Update app/services/api/users.ts to call `/api/users/*` endpoints
4. Update app/services/api/activities.ts to call activity endpoints
5. Remove all remaining Supabase references

### Priority 3: Fix Component Dependencies (Phase 5)
1. Update StarButton and ForkButton to use API routes
2. Update AuthCallback page (or remove if not needed)
3. Test all user flows

### Priority 4: Testing (Phase 7)
1. Test idea creation with workspace
2. Test collaborator limits (max 3)
3. Test fork functionality
4. Test privacy controls
5. Test all navigation routes

---

## üìù IMPORTANT NOTES

### Constraints to Follow
1. **NO CHANGES** to component styles or themes
2. **NO CHANGES** to working workspace functionality
3. **PRESERVE** all user flow constraints
4. **ENFORCE** max 3 collaborators per idea
5. **MAINTAIN** one workspace per idea relationship

### Technical Decisions
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: To be decided (NextAuth.js recommended)
- **Styling**: Preserved from IDEA_HUB (idea-hub.css + globals.css)
- **State Management**: React Context (Auth, Theme)

### Known Issues
- Prisma client generation requires database connection (blocked by network)
- Some linter warnings need fixing (non-blocking)
- Import paths need updating throughout codebase
- Supabase API calls need replacing

```

### Key Insights

1. **Rapid Progress:** Completed 3.5 phases in one session
2. **Structural Foundation:** All infrastructure is in place
3. **Clean Separation:** Services need updating but structure is clean
4. **Ready for Auth:** AuthContext stub makes auth implementation straightforward
5. **No Blockers:** Can build and run, just needs functional auth

### Recommendations for Next Iteration

1. **Start with NextAuth.js:** It's the fastest path to working auth
2. **Parallel Work Possible:** Services can be updated while auth is being implemented
3. **Testing Early:** Start testing as soon as auth is functional
4. **Incremental Deployment:** Can deploy with demo/stub auth for preview
